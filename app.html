	    5 WAYS PROGRAMMERS THINK
	  </p>1. Procedural Thinking - By finding a solution step by step 1-2-3.
	  <br />2. Abstract Thinking - By using concepts 1+1=2.
	  <br />3. Systematic Debugging - Finding the main cause to a problem and fixing it.
	  <br />4. Technological Empathy - How a computer thinks.
	  <br />5. Systems Thinking - Taking a big idea and breaking it down

	    	DEFINITIONS
	    </p>
	  	<p>Webpage:
	  	<br />A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML (
	  	<b>H</b>yper
	  	<b>t</b>ext 
	  	<b>M</b>arkup 
	  	<b>L</b>anguage).</p>
	  	<p>Coding:
	  	<br />Coding is what happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.
	  	<br /></p>
	  	<p>Tag:
	  	<br />A tag is a command. 
	  	<u>ALL</u> tags have opening tags, but 
	  	<u>some</u> do not have closing tags, these are called &quot;void tags&quot;. See some examples of tags below.</p>
	  	<p>Inline Tags vs. Block Tags:
	  	<br />Inline tags enclose content tightly. Block tags enclose content with a block creating a paragraph look.</p>
	  	<p>Element:
	  	<br />An Element is everything in between a set of opening and closing tags.</p>
	  	<p>Attribute:
	 	 <br />An attribute is a property of an HTML element which provides additional information about the data within the element. For
	 	 example: HREF (
		  <b>H</b>ypertext 
		  <b>REF</b>erence)</p>

	    REMEMBER
	    </p>
	  <p>HTML and CSS are both &quot;languages&quot;
	  <br />
	  <br />HTML controls the &quot;structure&quot; of a web page
	  <br />
	  <br />CSS controls the &quot;style&quot; of a page (how it looks).
	  <br />
	  <br />When programmers talk about the &quot;DOM&quot; (Document Object Model) they are talking about the tree-like structure of a
	  page.

	  		CSS NOTES
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		CSS is what makes your web page look, well, pretty! But.... how do you use it? Here are a couple pointers.
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		1. You cam choose to write your css in your HTML or a seperate css file. Saving it in a seperate css file is the most efficient way though.
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		2. To point your css coding to the right direction you have to identify what you are giving stlye to. Here is how:
	  	<p>
	  		a. To point to a parragraph with a class, you start with "p." followed by the class name.
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		b. To point to a parragraph with an id, you start with "p#" followed by the class name.
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		c. To point to an image with a class, you start with "img." followed by the class name.
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		d. To point to an image with an id, you start with "img#" followed by the class name.
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		3. After pointing your code to the right direction, in curly brackets, type up your style!
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		4. It is important to NOT use repitition. It's simply a waste of time. That's when using "class" comes in handy.
